## Features Left to Implement
- In the future a shop online to allow the user to purchase the classes directly on the website will be added.
- Another feature to implement, would be a booking system for the user to book their own classes as they suit them. 

## Testing
- I have tested this webpage using the devtools devise tools bar to make sure it is responsive and functions on different screen sizes.
- I have make sure that the Logo, Home page, Pricing, Schedule and Contact are readable, responsive an easy to undestand.

## Bugs
- When the project was deployed I discovered that none of th pictures where working. After examing the code I discover I used and absolute path to the images. Once **../** was removed from the code the problem was fixed.
